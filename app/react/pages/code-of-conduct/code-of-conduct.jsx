                <li>The Mozilla Science Lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</li>
                <li>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event.</li>
                <li>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.</li>
                <li>Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</li>
                <li>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the conference organizers without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>The Longer Version</h2>

              <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

              <p>If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund of any fee that may have been levied.</p>
