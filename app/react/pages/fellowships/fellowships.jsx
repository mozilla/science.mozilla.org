              <h2>About the Program</h2>

              <p>The Mozilla Fellowships for Science present a unique opportunity for researchers who want to influence the future of open science and data sharing within their communities.</p>
              <p>We're looking for researchers with a passion for open source and data sharing, already working to shift research practice to be more collaborative, iterative and open. Fellows will spend 10 months starting September 2018 as community catalysts at their institutions, mentoring the next generation of open data practitioners and researchers and building lasting change in the global open science community.</p>
              <p>Throughout their fellowship term, chosen fellows will receive training and support from Mozilla to hone their skills around open source, data sharing, open science policy and licensing. They will also craft code, curriculum and other learning resources that help their local communities learn open data practices, and teach their institutional peers.</p>

              <h3 className="mb-3">Expectations</h3>
              <p>We anticipate applicants who:</p>

              <Collapse>
                <Panel header={`I live outside of the US, UK or Canada - am I eligible?`}>
                  <p>{`Yes, as long as you are legally allowed to work in the country where you currently reside. Our fellowship application is a global call for researchers.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`What disciplines are included in the eligible sciences?`}>
                  <p>{`Previously, our fellowship focused on the physical and natural sciences: biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, astronomy, ecology, etc.`}</p>
                  <p>{`We’ve opened our current application eligibility to include the social and library sciences; in fact, all scientific disiplines are welcome among our applicants. Strong attachment to furthering open scientific research in some capacity is favored, and a recommended emphasis in the applications we receive. This year, we'll also be particularly seeking open biomedical researchers, so please apply if you think your voice is under-represented in that field. We'd love to promote it!`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`I work at a research institution but not a "university" - can I still apply?`}>
                  <p>{`You bet! Government funded research institutions and groups (e.g., National Institutes of Health, Environmental Protection Agency, or research centers like NEON, BEACON, etc) as well as positions in other research institutions (e.g., Museum of Natural History and many Planetariums have research arms, as well) count!`}</p>
                  <p>{`Still unsure? Let us know - we'd be happy to talk it through, you can reach out to sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org with questions!`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`I'm not currently at a university or research institution - can I still apply?`}>
                  <p>{`Fellows are required to be based at a university or research institution for the 10-month tenure. Mozilla cannot assist Fellows in finding placements.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`Can I continue my research, coursework or teaching during this time?`}>
                  <p>{`It depends. Fellows are allowed to spend up to 20% of their time maintaining their work for their home institution - think, 1 day a week. Please note: This is a time commitment, and Fellows are expected to devote the bulk of their time to the Fellowship, their projects and interaction with the Mozilla community. If you have a standing commitment that you think may affect your time, please note in your application.`}</p>
                  <p>{`Fellowship applicants must have buy-in from their advisors in advance, and include advisors’ contact information on the application. Advisors will be interviewed separately should applicants move on to the second round, and their support will be a critical consideration for acceptance of fellows.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`When are Fellowships intended to start? And end?`}>
                  <p>{`The anticipated start date for Fellows is in September 2018, running to the end of June 2019, for the 10 months of the fellowship duration. After the CFP launches in March, the application will be open through April 20th, 5:00PM ET (a Friday). The Science Lab team will review applications for the subsequent two weeks, and request interviews with applicants (two rounds of interviews) and their advisors before making offers in early June, and responding to all applicants by mid-June. Fellows will be announced officially in June 2018.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`When will we be notified if we're selected?`}>
                  <p>{`The notification date will vary depending on the volume of applications received but we project that prospective candidates will be contacted by the last week in June, 2018.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`What sort of travel is expected?`}>
                  <p>{`Fellows are expected to be able to travel as part of the fellowship. Travel will include,  at a minimum: onboarding (likely late Sept / early October; location TBD), the Mozilla Festival (Oct. 26-28 in London), one fellows' summit in 2018 (location TBD), a Working Open Workshop (location TBD), an “off-boarding” week at the conclusion of the fellowship (sometime in June; location TBD).`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`I'm a pre-tenure, early career faculty member - does that rule me out?`}>
                  <p>{`Not necessarily! Be sure to list your teaching commitments in the application, as there are travel obligations and expectations that we want to make sure you have adequate time to accommodate. In general, we are flexible and happy to negotiate an arrangement that works best for you.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`What role does my advisor play in this process?`}>
                  <p>{`As the Fellows work somewhat autonomously within their institutions, we want to make sure Fellows are in supportive environments. We find this is best achieved with advisors who are supportive and tuned-in to the challenges around open research practice and data sharing within the institution. Having internal support is an excellent way to further the fellows' work, and advisors are excellent advocates on the 10 month path to build momentum, teach, and collaboratively advance open science within their labs and research settings.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`How will I be funded over the Fellowship?`}>
                  <p>{`Funding and additional supplements for which fellows may be eligible are allocated to the individual directly on a monthly basis, not run through institutions. No university overhead-like arrangements - the funding goes straight to the Fellow themselves.`}</p>
                </Panel>

                <Panel header={`What are the tax considerations alluded to in the call for applications?`}>
                  <p>{`Proposed fellowship amounts are gross amounts and may be reduced by applicable taxes.  Fellows are responsible to pay all applicable taxes, whether in their home jurisdictions, the jurisdiction where the fellowship occurs, or any other jurisdiction.  In some cases Mozilla may be required to withhold taxes at the time of payment, and reduce the amount of fellows’ payments accordingly.  For instance, Mozilla may have to withhold up to 30% of any stipend payments attributable to fellowship activities taking place in the U.S., although fellows may be able to claim reduced rates of withholding or refund of a portion of these taxes. It is fellows’ responsibility to communicate in advance with Mozilla about where they will be located throughout the fellowship.`}</p>
