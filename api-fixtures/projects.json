    "description": "Recent discoveries in the genetics of bacteria and phages (genetic material that infects bacteria) have exposed an interesting fact: bacteria retain copies of phage genes in their own DNA, for use in identifying and resisting dangerous infections. Understanding this mechanism better could substantially advance our understanding of disease immunity.",
